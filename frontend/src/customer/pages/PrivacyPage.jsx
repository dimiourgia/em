The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Advertisers: We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.
